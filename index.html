      <b>Unit 1</b>
      <hr>
      <p> In Unit 1 of Design and Development, I learned about the Basics of HTML and Digital Information. I was
        introduced to key vocabulary to develop my learning abilities regarding the components of HTML and the Digital
        World. I learned what web pages and websites, how they were structured, and how copyright worked. HTML refers to
        Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is used to build the websites we currently use daily. I learned that
        Programmers use various tags as the building blocks when creating HTML web pages. It is essential for a website
        that is coded in HTML to utilize these tags: !DOCTYPE html, html, head, body. These tags are not visible to the
        user but visible to the programmer. These are a few of the tags needed to create the content for an HTML
        webpage: p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, ol, ul, li. From the Digital Information sections, I learned how to
        understand complex information like binary numbers, text, images, lossy/lossless compression, and the digital
        dilemmas that are affecting the world today.</p>

      <b>Unit 2</b>
      <hr>
      <p>In Unit 2 of Design and Development, I learned about CSS, which stands for Cascade Style Sheets. I learned that
        with CSS, I can personalize a web page by customizing the content to fit my design. This is done through a
        combination of HTML tags and CSS syntax. Websites that utilize CSS will have a style.css file to customize the
        text. This is done by identifying the tag that will be stylized. From The Internet section, I learned how the
        Internet was created to help connect billions of people and systems. I learned how the different protocols of
        the internet work and how they are built. Through extensive research, I discovered the impacts the internet has
        on modern life regarding Net Neutrality. This protocol prevented IPs from being biased towards certain
        networks/devices, where they could either receive more or receive less bandwidth.</p>

    <div class="wave" id="u3">
      <b>Unit 3</b>
      <hr>
      <p>In Unit 3 of Design and Development, I learned about JavaScript and was introduced to App Design. I learned
        that designing my app requires me to review other apps to think of my app and how I would like to design it and
        its purpose. From the Intro to App Design sections, I learned the importance of skills like pair programming,
        debugging, and user feedback. I learned how to create and design a user interface when building the prototype of
        my app. I also learned how to write event-driven code. This ultimately helped me design my first app, which
        helped users gain knowledge on the Original Trilogy of Star Wars.</p>

    <div class="wave" id="u4">
      <b>Unit 4</b>
      <hr>
      <p>In Unit 4 of Design and Development, I learned about Variables, Conditionals, and Functions. I expanded my
        knowledge on Javascript with the introduction of variables. I learned how these variables worked by
        investigating apps with pair programming with a classmate. Variables could either be global or local depending
        on the code. I learned how Conditionals through investigating and debugging apps that utilized conditionals
        within their code. Conditionals rely on If statements. These statements will output either true/false responses
        depending on the Boolean values. We learned about Comparison Operators, which tell the computer if the values
        are greater, less, or equal. Logical Operators include helped us create certain conditons based on comparison
        operators. Finally, we learned Functions by debugging and modifying code within apps to help simplify the code
        for programmers. I learned that Functions are usually created at the end of the code and can be called in the
        code with a function call to output the commands. With this knowledge of Variables, Conditionals, and Functions,
        I designed my own decision-maker app, which helped users pick what sport they wanted to play and how to improve
        in that sport based on three conditions; Age, Athletic Ability, and Picked Sport. </p>
