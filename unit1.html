        <h1>Lesson #1 - C.F.U - Welcome to CSP</h1> <b>Q: What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn
          best? And, how
          are
          they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</b>
        <p>My strategy towards learning is by following the examples of my teacher and my peers. I will ask my teachers
          or peers about the topic if I am confused and have a question. I will also remember what I learn by taking
          extensive notes.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #2 - C.F.U - Representing Information</h1> <b>Q: Recall when you built your information sending
          device. Why did we decide to
          send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</b>
        <p>When we built the information sending device, we chose to send the message as a sequence of two options to
          represent a question that could only have two answers to avoid representing more options.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #3 - C.F.U - Circle Square Patterns</h1> <b>Q: How would you explain a number system to someone who
          had never seen numbers
          before?</b>
        <p>I would explain a number system to someone who has never seen a number by using shapes to introduce counting.
          I would ask them to count the amount of the shapes or a combination of the amounts of shapes that can be made.

        <h1>Lesson #4 - C.F.U - Binary Numbers</h1>
        <b>Q: Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its
          system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses
          8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will
          have?</b>
        <p>A. The 8-bit system will be able to represent twice as many values as the 4-bit system. <br>
          B. The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system. <br>
          C. The 8-bit system will be able to represent eight times as many values as the 4-bit system. <br>
          D. The 8-bit system will be able to represent the same number of values as the 4-bit system, it will just
          include more zeros.</p>
        <p>Answer choice B: <b>The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit
            system.</b> <br> <br> This is because an 8-bit system can represent 256 values, while a 4-bit system can
          only represnt
          16 values.</p>
        <hr>
        <b>Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?</b>
        <p>Each time we add another bit, the amount of numbers we can make will double. For example, a 4-bit system can
          represent 16 values, but an 8-bit system can represent upto 256 values.</p>
        <hr>
        <b>How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today?</b>
        <p>There are a total of 25 students in class today, so we would need a total of 8 bits to count all of the
          students in class today.</p>
        <hr>
        <b>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</b>
        <p>Similarity: Both Binary and Decimal systems utilize a base of 2.</p>
        <p>Difference: Binary systems use a base of 2, while decimal systems use a base of 10.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #5 - C.F.U - Overflow and Rounding</h1>
        <b>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car
          drives beyond its maximum reading?</b>
        <p>When the car drives beyond its maximum reading, the Odometer rolls over to zero when it reaches its maximum
        </p>
        <hr>
        <b>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why
          not?</b>
        <p>Bits cannot represent every single fraction. However, Bits are capable of representing some fractions.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #7 - C.F.U - Black and White Images</h1>
        <b>Which of the following would result in a better digital approximation of an analog black and white image?</b>
        <p> A. Increasing the size of each sample square, thus decreasing the number of samples taken. <br>
          B. Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of samples taken. <br>
          C. Using fewer bits to represent the image. <br>
          D. Using decimal numbers to represent each pixel.</p>
        <p>Answer choice B: <b> Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of samples
            taken.</b> <br> <br> When you decrease the size of each sample square, you are increasing the number of
          samples to be taken</p>
        <hr>
        <b>Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that
          were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.</b>
        <p> A. The 32 bits of pixel data is enough to produce the image using the widget. Nothing else is needed. <br>
          B. The digital image would be an exact copy of the analog image. <br>
          C. The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image. <br>
          D. The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were
          used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.</p>
        <p>Answer Choices C & D <br> <br>
          Choice C: <b>The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image.</b>
          <br> Choice D: <b>The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large
            sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.</b>

        <b>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you
          sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would
          you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?</b>
        <p>I would divide the image into a smaller grid to help show the details while keeping the file size small.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #8 - C.F.U - Color Images</h1>
        <b>Which statement about analog and digital images is true?</b>
        <p> A. With advances in technology, digital images look exactly like the analog images they represent. <br>
          B. Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation. <br>
          C. Analog images come from data that is measured at regular intervals. <br>
          D. Digital images come from data that is measured continuously.</p>
        <p>Answer Choice B: <b>Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better
            representation.</b> <br> <br> This is because sampling an analog image allows you to get a better digital
          representation by capturing more information from the original image</p>
        <hr>
        <b>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital
          color image.</b>
        <p>Sampling helps divide the image into pixels with RGB, which is represented by binary sequences (0s and 1s).
          This will eventually create an approximate of the original image.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #9 - C.F.U - Lossless Compression</h1>
        <b>What is the most important quality of lossless compression?</b>
        <p> A. The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.
          <br>
          B. The data is transformed to always make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.
          <br>
          C. The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It cannot always be re-constructed back to the
          original. <br>
          D. The data is transformed to always make it smaller. It cannot always be re-constructed back to the original.
        </p>
        <p>Answer Choice A: <b>The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back
            to the original.</b> <br> <br> This is true because the data transformed through lossless compression is
          usually smaller and can be reconstructed back to the original.</p>

        <b>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer
          is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset
          because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.

          If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</b>
        <p>The words in the book are not lost. The emailing service is just compressing the information to send it
          easily to the publisher. No data will be lost because it is was compressed through lossless compression. This
          type of compression will not delete any of the original data.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #10 - C.F.U - Lossy Compression</h1>
        <b>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages,
          images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of
          these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</b>
        <p>I would use <b>Lossless</b> compression for text messages because of the need for letters and symbols, which
          need to be kept the same. <br> <br> I would use <b>Lossy</b> compression for images and videos to reduce the
          file size.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #11 - C.F.U - Intellectual Property</h1>
        <b>How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright?</b>
        <p> A. It is different in name only - in practice, it does the same thing. <br> B. It allows others to share and
          reuse your work if they pay you first. <br> C. It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help
          spark more creativity. <br> D. It is the most restrictive type of copyright, not allowing anyone to use your
          work for any reason.</p>
        <p>Answer Choice C: <b>It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.</b>

        <b>As a reminder, in the warm-up we saw this scenario: Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to
          create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took
          that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each. Now that we understand Copyright, what
          would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?</b>
        <p>This scenario would become okay if I give my friend permission to use my image on a t-shirt. I could also ask
          my friend to pay me for using my image</p>

        <p><b>Benefits:</b> People from around the world can view the paintaings remotely. <br> <br> <b>Harms:</b>
          Copyright issues could arise from users online uploading the collections</b></p>
        <hr>
        <b>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</b>
        <p>We should care about information being represented digitally because it gives us the ability efficiently
