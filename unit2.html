      <b>Unit #2 - The Internet</b>

      <div class="wave" id="u2l1">
        <h1>Lesson #1 - C.F.U - Welcome to the Internet</h1> <b>Q: How do you use the Internet? Think about your typical
          day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?</b>
        <p>I use the internet daily. I could be watching youtube, scrolling Instagram, or completing homework remotely.
          I also send messages or videos to my friends to stay connected. Internet helps me stay connected with all my
          friends.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #2 - C.F.U - Building a Network</h1> <b>Q: Describe two different paths that a message could take
          from Person A to Person D.</b> <br> <br> <img src="u2l2_image.png" width="150px" alt="Image of the Internet">
        <p>To balance out the network, we can set up multiple different hubs to make sure everyone is connected to each
          other, which leads to a direct connection to the people.</p>

      <div class="wave" id="u2l3">
        <h1>Lesson #3 - C.F.U - The Need for Addressing</h1> <b>Q: Pick the two statements that are true about the
          Internet Protocol (IP):</b>
        <p>I would explain a number system to someone who has never seen a number by using shapes to introduce counting.
          I would ask them to count the amount of the shapes or a combination of the amounts of shapes that can be made.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <b>Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.</b>
        <p>The Internet Protocol acts like a global addressing system, assigning unique numerical labels (IP addresses)
          to every device connected to the internet.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #4 - C.F.U - Routers and Redundancy</h1>
        <b>Pick Two: If the post office delivered mail exactly like the routers deliver messages on the Internet, which
          of the following statements would be true?</b>
        <p> A. One mailman would be responsible for delivering a letter from sender to receiver <br>
          B. The mailman would sometimes take a different path to deliver each letter to your home <br>
          C. Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put inside
          envelopes
          D. Your mail could not be delivered if a road your mailman was planning to take were under construction. </p>
        <p>Answer Choices B & C</p>
        <p>Choice B: <b>The mailman would sometimes take a different path to deliver each letter to your home.</b> <br>
          <br>
          Choice C: <b>Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put
            inside envelopes</b>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <b>What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building
          redundancy?</b>
        <p>Redundancy improves reliability by providing alternate paths for data if a component fails. However,
          Redundancy could be costly for a network to maintain.</p>

        <h1>Lesson #5 - C.F.U - Packets</h1>
        <b>Which of the following is true regarding the way information is transmitted on the Internet?</b>
        <p> A. Information flows on a dedicated direct connection from the sender's device to the receiver's device
          using binary electrical signals. <br>
          B. If a single packet is dropped, the entire file must be resent. <br>
          C. Because of the reliability of the Internet, packets always arrive in the same order they were sent. <br>
          D. Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.</p>
        <p>Answer Choice D: <b>Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.</b></p>
        <hr>
        <b>Match the definitions to the words</b>
        <p>A. Rules for addressing and sending data across the internet by assigning unique numbers to each connected
          device <br>
          B. Takes inventory of all packets in the datastream to ensure they are successfully sent and received. <br>
          C. Chunk of data and its metadata, used to route and reassemble information on the Internet. <br>
          D. The way in which information travels on the Internet, not as a single piece but in chunks. <br>
          E. Sends all packets without checking whether they were received or ordered properly</p>
        <p>- Packet <br>- Datastream <br>- Internet Protocol (IP) <br>- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <br>- User
          Datagram Protocol</p>
        <p><b>A. Internet Protocol</b></p>
        <p><b>B. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</b></p>
        <p><b>C. Packet</b></p>
        <p><b>D. Datastream</b></p>
        <p><b>E. User Datagram Protocol</b></p>

        <h1>Lesson #6 - C.F.U - HTTP and DNS</h1>
        <b>In your own words explain the following about the Domain Name System (DNS). What problem does the DNS solve?
          How does the DNS help the world wide web scale so that billions of users can access billions of web pages?</b>
        <p> The Domain Name System (DNS) solves problems like translating complex IP addresses into more understanable
          domain names, like "google.com". The DNS helps navigating the web much more easier and scales to handle
          billions of users and websites.</p>

        <b>Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide Web</b>
        <p>A. The World Wide Web is a protocol used for sharing HTTP messages <br>
          B. The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using HTTP <br>
          C. Computers will send information using either HTTP or the World Wide Web, but not both. <br>
          D. HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet
        </p>
        <p>Answer Choices B & D</p>
        <p>Choice B: <b>The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using
            HTTP</b></p>
        <p>Choice D: <b>HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on

        <h1>Lesson #7 - C.F.U - Project</h1>
        <p>In this project, we had to research an Internet Dilemma. This was presented to our candidate to help inform
          them to make an educated decision about the policy that we present to them. I chose to research about Net
          Neutrality.</p>
